Hi Team. I could not get this information from your 
report: is your emotion detector working better now?
Because I remember you had around ~68% accuracy 
which needs to be improved. If it is not improved yet, please 
work on it ASAP as there is little time left.
Looking at your code, you are getting around 91% train 
error. That means a stronger model would probably do better!
Also, there is a large gap between validation and train accuracy.
This means you are overfitting. Do you have L2 regularization on 
each kernel? use L2 of 4E-5 or something. Also it seems like 
you are not normalizing your images (feature wise center and std normalized) 
is there a good reason for that? Are they already normalized?

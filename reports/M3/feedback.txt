Hi team, great progress. However, regarding the 
facial emotion detector network, there are some 
comments/concerns:
Why is ResNet changed to Xception? I don't think you are justifying this in your milestone. Also, I'm not convinced that 
regular convolution runs faster than depthwise seprable convolutions.
Please use published reference or data when you are making such claims.
Beside that, 68% accuracy is not so good. I suggest you try some things:
- try more powerful networks (ResNet50 or Inception)
- try data augmentation (random flip, random rotation etc.)
- try regularization techniques such as L2 etc. 
- different LR scheduling and optimizers
